I can draw text to the screen - but it's horrible and seems to refresh after every key press, it also puts all text on a new line

To Do:
- Fix typing to be single line unless return pressed, make sure backspace works correctly
- Output delay (don't refresh the screen until done typing)
- Support for creating/opening files to be written to
